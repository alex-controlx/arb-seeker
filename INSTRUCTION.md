Here is your step-by-step action plan for every notification:

### 1. The Alert 🚨
You receive a Telegram message:
> **ARB FOUND: 8.70%**
> Strategy: Back **$315** on **Sportsbet** @ 2.50
> Betfair Status: ⚠️ Manual Lay Required

### 2. The Decision (5 Seconds)
Decide your stake immediately.
* **Option A (Trust the Bot):** You are happy to bet **$315**.
* **Option B (Start Small):** You only want to bet **$30** (approx 10%).

### 3. The Execution (30-60 Seconds)

**Step A: The Bookie (ALWAYS FIRST)**
1.  Tap **"OPEN SPORTSBET APP"**.
2.  It takes you deep into the specific game.
3.  **Verify:** Is the price still **2.50**?
    * *If Yes:* Enter your stake (**$30** or $315) and **PLACE BET**.
    * *If No (Odds dropped to 2.40):* **ABORT.** Do not place the bet. The arb is gone.

**Step B: The Exchange (IMMEDIATELY AFTER)**
1.  Switch back to Telegram.
2.  Tap **"OPEN BETFAIR"**.
3.  It takes you to the matching market.
4.  **Verify:** Is the Pink "Lay" price still **2.30** (or lower)?
    * *If Yes:* Click the Pink Box.
    * *If No (Price rose to 2.60):* You are in trouble. You have to take a small loss to close the position.
5.  **Enter Stake:**
    * If you bet **$315** on Bookie -> Enter **$315** (or slightly more/less depending on precise calculator, but equal stake is usually safe for starting).
    * If you bet **$30** on Bookie -> Enter **$30** on Betfair.
6.  **Place Bet.**

### 4. The Result
* **You are done.** You have now locked in a guaranteed profit (the difference in odds).
* One account will go up, the other will go down, but your **Total Net Worth** just increased.

### ⚠️ Golden Rule
**Never bet on Betfair first.**
Liquidity on Betfair is usually "sticky," but Bookie odds change instantly. If you bet on Betfair and then find the Bookie odds have dropped, you are stuck with a losing position. Always secure the "weak" leg (the Bookie) first.
